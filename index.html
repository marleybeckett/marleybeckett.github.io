          <p class="bio-text">
            I am currently working towards my Master of Applied Science in 
            Electrical Engineering at the UBC. 
            My studies are focused in the areas of wireless communications protocols, 
            low power IoT, and machine learning.

    <section class="more-about" id="more-about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a passionate individual who thrives on curiosity, always eager 
          to uncover the "why" and "how." My refusal to settle for the status 
          quo drives me to push boundaries and explore new horizons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC</a> focusing on the fusion of 
          in electrical and computer engineering, specifically exploring low-power, 
          low-complexity, backscattering IoT devices. As a proud recipient of the 
         <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp">
           NSERC Canadian Graduate Scholarship for Master’s </a> (CGS M), I actively 
          collaborate with industry professionals and participate in 3GPP meetings 
          to bring cohesion to this multifaceted domain.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from 
          <a href="https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/">Queen’s University </a> (’21), where my 
          dedication to community involvement, academic excellence, and innovative thinking earned 
          me the <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid/application-required/future-students/major-awards">Chancellor 
          Scholarship.</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Throughout my university education, I have combined academic and athletic 
          pursuits. I have competed in Varsity Cross Country and Track and Field, 
          securing three national championship titles. You will often find me immersed 
          in the vibrant outdoor scene of Vancouver. cruising through local 
          trails on my mountain bike, skiing the local mountains, or catching the sunset 
          from summits, I believe in making every moment count. Whether delving into the 
          wilderness in my backyard or embarking on a four-month trek from Mexico to Canada, 
          the idea of "what else is out there" is always on my mind.
